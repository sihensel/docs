# Awesome Window Manager

This document cover the general configs and tweaks of the awesome window manager used by me.

## File locations

The `rc.lua` config file is usually located at `/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua`.
Copy it to `~/.config/awesome` and edit it there.

The `theme.lua` file is located at `/usr/share/awesome/themes/zenburn/theme.lua`. To make changes to this file, edit it directly in the `/usr/` folder. Theretically, you can copy it over into your `.config/`-folder, but I didn't find a way to tell awesome to refer to ne new themes file.

## Needes Software

This software is needed so the `rc.lua` file runs without issues.
- slock
- dmenu
